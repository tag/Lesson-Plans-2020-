  * `required`
  * input types: email, number, url, text
    - watch out for leading zeros
  * input, `min` and `max` attributes for numbers,

if (form.checkValidity() === false) {
```

## CSS:
  * `:required`, `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-classes

  * Bootstrap recipes: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/#validation
