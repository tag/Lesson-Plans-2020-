# In-class project, 2021 (remaining time)

Let's build a job offer data collection system.

* Should it be an app? Costs/benefits?
* How simple or complex? (MVP?)
* What will the data look like? (And why?)
  - Dirty, user generated
  - Accurate? Timely?
  - Trade-off between user-entered and admin-entered
* Who will the users be? (roles)

* What is out development process?
  - ad-hoc (Necessary, inevitable, but not the best)

# Case competition review (2019)

    - This is a safe place
* Answer the right question

* Appendices. Always
* Accepting feedback

# Course project (in-class) (30 mins ?)

## Three parts of an application:

  1. UI
  2. Architecture
  3. Data store

We made some technology decisions early:

  * Mobile, from any computer --> web-app
  * Some technology decisions (PHP, MySQL) were made because of a standard LAMP stack in the company
    - (Explain LAMP)

### 1. UI (15/30?)

  <!-- * Demo a selection matrix
    - WinGUI|iOS|Android|Web
    - Criteria? (ask for ideas)
      .  mobile, developers, documentation, testable (not really relevant), easy to build charts -->

  * HTML (mobile-ready)
  * What is a Javascript framework?
    - Why VueJS?
  * Just sketch this on a piece of paper

### 2. Architecture
  * Tiers
  * Microservices

### 3. Data store
  * Discuss how we'll be storing our data:
    - This application will have its own database, but will need to be designed to sync with other applications.

# Let's build an application!
Emergency room/health care clinic waiting room (see slides)

### Build a repo (5 min)

* Show how the git/GitHub tools work in Atom

### Build data model (last ~20 min?)

* Based on description, sketch one out as a team
* Review

* Show my preview sketches (5/25)
    - Build HTML?


<!-- # For Next Time (5 mins?)

  * Group recommendations for which front-end library
    - React | Knockout | AngularJS (aka Angular 1) | Manually w/ jQuery & Handlebars | VueJS (w/ Axios?)
    - NOT Angular (aka Angular 2), NOT Ember -->
