# History of AWS (really should do this earlier)

# Unit testing

  - Unit vs functional testing
    - Define "acceptance testing"
  - Test coverage
  - Test-driven development
    * Not necessarily unit test! BDD, functional; may test _processes_, not just units
  - Consequences of requiring testing -> afterthought

  - Automated testing; automated response
    * Developers should be able to easily run tests
    * Test should be automated, and run at every commit
    * "Siren"/stuffed animal story: Who broke the build?

## DevOps

  - "Continuous Integration"
  - "Continuous Delivery"
  - "Continuous Deployment"
    * What about "Change control"?

      * authentication, bug bounty

# Validation ?

# AWS ?
